Tried recalibrating the deduped bams, which all failed with a java memory warning. 
Doubled the memory available to 32, 64, and 128G, all of which failed the same way. 
Starting investigating:

Mel_5_Recal_test_01.sh
One sample, restriced to chromosome 20
Failed after 20 minutes several times. "You have not provided enough memory to Java"

Mel_5_Recal_test_01_Jess.sh
One sample from Jess, again restricted to Chr 20. Reference and known sites from hg19. 
It ran fine. 

Mel_5_Recal_test_02_Jess.sh
Second recalibration, also fine

Mel_5_Recal_test_03_Jess.sh
Produced report, fine

Mel_5_Recal_test_04_Jess.sh
Print reads, looks fine. 

Melarray_recal_etc_1 and 2
Realigned and recalibrated an old set of WES files. Worked.

Validate_sam.sh
Uses picardtools validatesamfile to check all the bams. They're all fine. 

Melarray_from_the_top
Just trying the whole pipeline again on the smallest exome files. 
From aligner to fixmate.
With GATK 3.8 instead of 3.7
It worked. 

Recalibrate_3.8.sh
Recal with the new GATK, using files from above. 
It failed as usual. 

GATK_3.8_whole_interval.sh
Same file as above, using whole interval list instead of chromosome 20

GATK_3.8_mitochndria
Same file as above, using just MT 
It worked!

GATK_3.8_small_interval
Same file as above, using a small interval -L 20:1-1000000
It worked!

calc_coverage.sh
On advice from GATK forums, checked the coverage. It might be too high. Used 2 different ways. 
About 1000 intervals over 400x, about 400 intervals over 500x

calc_coverage.sh
Check coverage of the melarray file from above to see if this is the difference.
